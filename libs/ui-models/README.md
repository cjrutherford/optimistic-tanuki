# UI Models

This library contains data models that are shared across multiple UI libraries. These models define the structure of the data that is passed between components.

## Usage

To use the models in this library, import them directly from the library:

```typescript
import { Button } from '@optimistic-tanuki/ui-models';
```

## Running unit tests

Run `nx test ui-models` to execute the unit tests.
