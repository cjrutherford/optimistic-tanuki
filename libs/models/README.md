# Models

This library contains data models that are shared across multiple applications. These models define the structure of the data that is passed between the frontend and backend.

## Usage

To use the models in this library, import them directly from the library:

```typescript
import { User } from '@optimistic-tanuki/models';
```

## Running unit tests

Run `nx test models` to execute the unit tests.
